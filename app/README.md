# Let's Make an App

## Design Specs
1. Usable on iPhone/Android
2. Downloadable from App store / Play Store
3. Upon open user is asked one question "Is the mountain out" and provided a big yes/no tap
4. Phone grabs lat/long or gps from the phone
5. saves data to backend database
6. update the image of the map with yes/no pins


## Important Note
Our app ```main.dart``` requires flutter. however flutter comes with a git repo built in. please note the ```install-flutter.sh``` script for details on setting up fllutter. You also have to make sure that your path is set correctly.

### Super important note

path to android sdk: ```~/Android```

path to flutter: ```~/Desktop/flutter```

we should probably be using Android Studio -- https://developer.android.com/studio?gad_source=1&gclsrc=ds
